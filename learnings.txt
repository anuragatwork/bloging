1.instead of code repeatation for example bootsrap cdn css link and script we use partials
to avoid that

2.to use nodemon in dev dependency do npm i nodemon -dependencythen go add 
in scripts in pckage.json  "dev": "nodemone index.js"
then do npm run dev in terminal

3.you have to create a schema by using mongoose library
schema contains list of objects each object(columns) is 1 property of that document(row)

4. then we create a model and instance of the model is our document

5.we can do encryption using library called crypto in nodemonwe use Schema.presave method
its a middle ware inside it we write our logic
note dont send arrow functions in presave argument
